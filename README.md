µBlitz (MicroBlitz) is intended to cause chaos in your life. µBlitz is designed to be configured for a Ruby on Rails app and at random it will delete any given file. This (probably) will result in some throw errors or a complete application shut down. This is an attempt at chaos engineering.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'micro_blitz'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install micro_blitz
